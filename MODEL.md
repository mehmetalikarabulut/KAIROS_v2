# KAIROS — UCTP Optimization Model

A formal description of the University Course Timetabling (UCTP) model implemented in
`src/timetabling/`. This is the ground-truth specification: it mirrors `model_cpsat.py`
(the declarative CP-SAT model), `repair.py` (the production solver), `config.py`
(the tunable defaults), and `settings.py` (the per-school overrides exposed in the UI's
School Settings step). When the code and this document disagree, the code wins — update
this file.

The solver decides, for each course **block**, a **(room, day, start-hour)**.
Section / instructor / size / T-P-L are fixed inputs; the only decisions are **time** and
**room**.

---

## 0. Scheduling constraints at a glance

A plain-language checklist of every rule the schedule obeys. Sections 3–6 give the formal
CP-SAT encoding; this list is the human-readable summary. Each item notes whether it is a
**hard** rule (can never be violated) or a **soft** preference (penalized, never blocking),
and where it lives (pruning, model relation, or objective).

### What is fixed vs. decided

- **Fixed inputs:** each section's instructor(s), Section Capacity (quota), and T/P/L hours.
- **Decided:** for every block of every section, a `(room, day, start-hour)`.
- A section has one uninterrupted block for each nonzero component: Theory `T`,
  Practice `P`, and Lab `L`. Components form a hard Theory → Practice → Lab
  sequence on the same day, so another subject cannot be inserted between them.

### Hard constraints — enforced by candidate pruning (per block)

A placement that breaks one of these is never even generated, so it cannot occur.

- **Capacity** — a block prefers a room whose capacity ≥ the section's size. The virtual
  `Online` room is exempt (unlimited).
- **Room matching** — physical rooms must match the block-aware category and capacity.
  P/L use the explicit section category; Theory in a mixed section uses classroom.
  Theory-only courses can explicitly request a specialist category. Without demand,
  Lab retains either-lab-category compatibility and T/P use classroom. A pinned lab
  must also pass category, capacity and ownership checks. Online applies to every
  component and bypasses physical room allocation.
- **Daytime window** — an undergraduate block must end by the **Day end** hour (default
  **18:00**; tunable 13–21 in School Settings) and start no earlier than the **Day start**
  hour (default **09:00**; tunable 6–12). Graduate blocks (if enabled) end by **21:00**
  (fixed — `horizon_end` is not a settings field) and start no earlier than the configurable
  **Graduate earliest start** hour (default **18:00**; tunable 6–20 in School Settings).
- **Blackout slots** — closed `(day, hour)` slots are **school-specific and configurable**
  (none by default; add them in the School Settings step). Each slot has a scope: *everyone*
  (closed for all sections) or *full-time only* (closed only when a section has a full-time
  staff instructor — e.g. a faculty seminar). Common examples: a Friday 13:00–14:00
  congregational-prayer hour (everyone), or a Thursday 14:00–16:00 staff seminar
  (full-time only).
- **Instructor availability (hard — unavailable)** — a block is never placed in any hour slot
  an instructor marked **unavailable**; every co-instructor's unavailability applies (a
  per-instructor blackout, set in the School Settings step). The availability grid is hourly.
- **Instructor avoid (soft)** — hours marked **avoid** incur a soft penalty (`w_instr_avoid`
  per overlapping hour) but do not block the placement. Applied in both the CP-SAT monolith
  objective and the repair soft polish.
- **Instructor preferred (soft miss-penalty)** — for instructors who have declared **preferred**
  hours, a block not landing in any of those hours incurs a soft miss-penalty (`w_instr_prefer`)
  per such instructor. Applied in both paths.
- **Fixed session** — if a section declares a fixed slot, its **first block** is pinned to
  exactly that `(day, start-hour)` (its remaining blocks schedule freely).
- **Room type** — canonical classroom, pc_lab, electronics_lab, online. Legacy
  normal/pc/lab/studio migrate respectively to those values (studio is online).
  normalize_room_type is the shared normalization boundary. A virtual inventory row
  is unlimited supply, not an exclusive physical room. Its administrative capacity
  does not limit attendance or enter utilization costs. Virtual rooms never enter
  building-change constraints, including virtual names beginning with building letters.
- **Assistant availability** — Unavailable removes P/L candidates for any assigned
  assistant. Theory ignores assistants. Avoid costs w_instr_avoid per marked hour;
  Prefer costs w_instr_prefer per assistant/block without any preferred-hour overlap.
  These soft terms apply in CP-SAT, repair construction/neighborhoods and soft polish.

### Hard constraints — enforced as model relations (across blocks)

- **Exactly-one placement** — every block is scheduled exactly once. (In the `--repair`
  solver this is relaxed so a block may stay unplaced, yielding a partial schedule.)
- **Room no-overlap** — at most one block occupies a physical room in any hour. (The `Online`
  virtual room is exempt.)
- **Instructor no-overlap** — no instructor is double-booked in any hour; every co-instructor
  of a team-taught section counts. Required P/L assistants share the same identity
  occupancy map, preventing assistant and cross-role double booking. Section keeps
  separate instructor_ids and assistant_ids; human_ids(kind) supplies the deduplicated
  union only for Practice/Lab. Decomposed reservations and repair moves honor it too.
- **Section self no-overlap** — two blocks of the same section never overlap in time.
### Soft preferences — penalized in the objective (never block a schedule)

Listed by default weight magnitude where that comparison is meaningful; weights live in
`config.py`, but `settings.build_config()` may zero or remap some UI-controlled terms at solve
time. The CP-SAT monolith (§6a) and the repair soft polish (§6b) use separate objectives — see
§5 for which terms belong to which path.

- **Cohort course-conflict** (`w_cohort_conflict=50`) — penalize each extra distinct course a
  `(dept, year)` cohort runs in the same slot (CP-SAT monolith objective; no-regress guard in
  repair polish). A *soft proxy* — a hard version was infeasible.
- **Student idle gaps** (`w_idle=15.0` repair / `w_cohort_gap=10.0` monolith) — penalize idle
  hours inside a cohort's day; always-on in the repair polish (fixed weight, not a UI dial).
- **Maxrun — anti-fatigue** (`w_maxrun=10.0`) — penalize consecutive teaching runs longer than
  `max_consecutive_hours`=3 h, over cohorts and instructors (repair polish).
- **Compress instructor weeks** (`w_instr_days=10.0` full-time, `w_parttime_days=14.0`
  part-time when an instructor-days target is active; repair polish uses `w_instr_days` only) —
  CP-SAT monolith penalizes every teaching day; repair polish penalizes days beyond
  `max_instr_days`. UI default is **No target** (opt-in: both weights forced to 0.0, since
  forcing few teaching days conflicts with session-gap / free-day spread); ≤4/≤3/≤2 sets the
  target and maps the priority preset to 5.0/10.0/20.0, with part-time set to `w_instr_days + 4.0`.
- **Room stability** (`w_room_stable=10.0`) — penalize each section that uses more than one
  room across its blocks (repair polish).
- **Section minimum working days** (`w_min_working_days=10.0`) — penalize each missing
  distinct day below a section's optional `Min Working Days` CSV target. The target is soft:
  unmet days are reported in `unmet_soft`, not as validation failures.
- **Theory different-day** — split theory sessions prefer different days, but may share a day
  as a fallback. CP-SAT uses `w_nonadjacent`; repair uses `_W_SAME_DAY = 50`.
- **Parallel section coordination** (`w_parallel_coord=10.0`) — optional course-code scoped
  repair-polish term. `same-time` nudges parallel theory sections toward the same
  `(day,start)`, `spread` penalizes parallel theory sections sharing a `(day,start)`, and
  `lab-after-theory` penalizes labs placed before their own section's theory. Blank or absent
  policy is inert; hard feasibility and the cohort-conflict no-regress guard stay dominant.
- **Avoid-conflict pairs** (`w_avoid_pairs=1.0`) — penalize each overlapping `(day, hour)`
  slot between blocks of a user-defined pair of course codes. For each `{code_a, code_b}` pair,
  counts the size of the intersection of occupied slots across all blocks of `code_a` and all
  blocks of `code_b`. Configured via the "Avoid Conflict" panel in School Settings
  (list of `[code_a, code_b]` pairs). Applies to both the CP-SAT monolith objective and the
  repair soft polish.
- **Free day** (`w_free_day=10.0`, year-scoped) — penalize each configured year-level cohort
  that occupies all working days (repair polish). The UI does not expose a free-day weight dial;
  the year multiselect is the on/off scope control. With no selected years, the term is inert.
- **Level ordering** (`w_order=1`) — prefer low-level courses early, high-level courses late;
  level-1 and graduate excluded (CP-SAT monolith).
- **Engineering labs late-week** (`w_englab=1`) — prefer Engineering lab blocks on Thu/Fri
  (CP-SAT monolith).
- **Room utilisation** (`w_room_util=1`) — penalize `(room_cap − students) / room_cap` per
  placed block (waste fraction, 0–1); discourages assigning small classes to very large
  auditoriums, independent of absolute room size. Capacity shortfall is also strongly
  penalized, but remains a soft diagnostic so a compatible undersized room can rescue a solve.
  Virtual rooms exempt. Applies to both the CP-SAT monolith and the repair solver
  (greedy, LNS sub-model, and soft polish).
- **Compact teaching days** (`w_nonadjacent`; UI default 10.0/medium, `Config()` default 0.0) —
  penalize the span between each instructor's first and last teaching day of the week
  (e.g. Mon–Fri = 4, Mon–Tue = 1, single day = 0); pushes teaching days to cluster together.
  Repair polish term; CP-SAT monolith reuses the same weight name for a different, narrower
  purpose (penalizing split blocks on the same day).
  UI dial: off / low / medium / high (default medium).
- **Late-hour load** (`w_evening`; UI default 10.0/medium, `Config()` default 0.0) — penalize occupied
  hour-slots at or after `evening_from_hour` (default 17:00) for both cohorts and instructors.
  Repair polish term; Settings dial: off / low / medium / high (default medium).
- **Instructor idle gaps** (`w_instr_idle`; UI default 10.0/medium, `Config()` default 0.0) — penalize
  same-day holes between an instructor's classes. Repair polish term; Settings dial:
  off / low / medium / high (default medium).
- **Bad-load fairness** (`w_fairness`; UI default 10.0/medium, `Config()` default 0.0) — square the
  per-cohort and per-instructor concentration of bad load (idle gaps + long runs + late slots),
  making it more expensive to dump all discomfort on the same entity. Repair polish term;
  Settings dial: off / low / medium / high (default medium).
- **Building transition cost** (`w_building_change=0.0` default) — penalize consecutive
  teaching hours for the same instructor that occur in different buildings on the same day.
  Building is derived from the room code prefix: first letter (`A`–`K`); `XB…` prefixes
  (bodrum/basement) resolve to building `X`. Online and unknown rooms are excluded.
  Repair polish term and CP-SAT monolith term (linearized `t ≥ v1 + v2 − 1`); off by default.
- **Department building compactness** (`w_dept_compact`; UI default 10.0/medium, `Config()` default 0.0) — penalize spreading a
  department across multiple buildings by counting placed blocks outside that department's
  most-used known building. Building is inferred from the same `building_of(room)` room-code
  prefix rule; `Online` and unknown buildings are ignored. Repair polish term only; Settings
  dial off / low / medium / high (default medium).
- **Department prime-time fairness** (`w_dept_fairness`; UI default 10.0/medium, `Config()` default 0.0) — balance each
  department's share of teaching hours placed in the prime-time window
  `[primetime_start, primetime_end)`, default 09:00-16:00. Uses `Section.department`
  (falling back to `dept_code`) and compares prime-time ratios, not raw counts. Active in
  CP-SAT and repair polish; Settings dial off / low / medium / high (default medium).
- **Minimum perturbation** (`w_perturbation=0.0` default) — penalize each block placed at a
  `(day, start, room)` that differs from the reference schedule uploaded by the user. The
  reference is a previously exported `schedule_*.json`; parsed by `load_ref_schedule` into
  `cfg.ref_schedule = {block_id: (day, start, room)}`. With an empty reference or
  `w_perturbation=0.0` the term is inert. Active in the repair greedy phase (`_cand_soft`),
  repair soft polish (`_global_terms` / `_local_terms` / `_norm_obj`), and the CP-SAT monolith
  objective. UI: optional JSON uploader in the Solve step expander; off by default.
- **Session day-gap** (`w_session_gap`; UI default 10.0/medium, `Config()` default 0.0) — penalize multi-session sections whose
  theory sessions are placed closer than `min_session_gap_days` apart (default 2 days). For
  each pair of consecutive session-days of the same section, shortfall = `max(0, min_gap −
  gap)` days; the term sums these across all sections. Repair soft polish only
  (`_session_gap_penalty` helper, `_global_terms` / `_local_terms` / `_norm_obj`). UI:
  Settings dial off / low / medium / high (default medium), with a companion 1/2/3-day radio
  for `min_session_gap_days`.

### What "0 resource conflicts" means

`validate.py` independently re-checks: placement, capacity, lab-room pins, categorical
room-type legality, fixed first-block pins, end-cap only for the time window (`a.end > end_cap`;
start lower bounds remain candidate-pruning rules), blackouts, per-instructor hard
unavailability, and room/instructor/self no-overlap. In benchmark summaries, "0 resource
conflicts" excludes `placement` violations caused by an unplaced tail; those are reported
separately. Cohort conflict and theory different-day are **soft metrics**, never hard
violations.

### Per-school configuration (School Settings)

Every value above is a default tuned to our own institution; the **School Settings** UI step
lets another school override them without touching code. A session **Settings** dict plus an
instructor-availability map are turned into a `Config` by `settings.build_config` at solve
time: the day window, blackout slots, Saturday toggle, graduate earliest-start controls,
block-split policy, the instructor-days target, free-day year scope, and the soft-preference
weights (as low / medium / high presets, with explicit off for the listed weight dials) are
configurable. Graduate courses are always
included in the UI; there is no graduate on/off checkbox. Optional course-list columns
(`Year`, `Part-time`, `Room Type`, `Fixed`, `Min Working Days`) override the string-derived
cohort / part-time / room demand / pin, or add a per-section soft day-spread target.
Unconfigured settings reproduce the UI defaults documented here exactly.
The pure profile JSON functions remain in `settings.py`, but the profile expander is currently
disabled in the UI (§8.5).
**§8 is the exhaustive control-by-control list of what the UI exposes.**

## 1. Sets and indices

| Symbol | Meaning | Source |
|---|---|---|
| $S$ | sections (one cohort offering of a course) | `derive.build_sections` |
| $B$ | blocks; each section contributes one or more | `derive.blocks_from_tpl` |
| $B_s \subseteq B$ | blocks of section $s$ | |
| $R$ | rooms, physical $R_{\text{phys}}$ plus virtual ($\texttt{Online}$) | `classrooms.csv`, `route.mark_virtual` |
| $I$ | instructors (a section may have several — team teaching) | `lecturers.csv` |
| $I_b \subseteq I$ | instructors of the section owning block $b$ | |
| $D$ | days $\{\mathrm{Mo,Tu,We,Th,Fr}\}$ (Sa optional) | `Config.days()` |
| $H$ | hour-slots, `horizon_start` $\le h <$ `horizon_end` (defaults: $9 \le h < 21$) | `horizon_start`, `horizon_end` |
| $K$ | cohorts $k=(\text{dept code},\ \text{year level})$ | `Section.cohort_key` |
| $\mathcal{C}(b)$ | legal candidate placements $(r,d,h)$ of block $b$ | `gen_candidates` |

**Blocks** are derived from a section's T/P/L hours:

- Each nonzero Theory, Practice, and Lab component is one uninterrupted block.
  Its duration is exactly the corresponding T/P/L value, so every scheduled hour
  is consecutive.
- Block ids are `#T`, `#P`, and `#L`; `section_id = block_id.split("#")[0]`.

## 3. Decision variables

| Symbol | Domain | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| $x_{b,r,d,h}$ | $\{0,1\}$ | $=1$ iff block $b$ occupies room $r$, day $d$, starting at hour $h$ |

- A variable is created **only for legal candidates** $(r,d,h)\in\mathcal{C}(b)$ — see the
  pruning note below. The full index product is never materialized.
- Auxiliary variables used by the objective and soft day-spread terms are derived from
  $x$: day-activity $z_{s,b,d}=\max_{r,h}x_{b,r,d,h}$, room-used, instructor-day indicators,
  and cohort slot-busy / first / last.

**Candidate pruning (key design decision).** Per-block hard rules are enforced by *not
creating* the variable rather than by adding a model row. `gen_candidates` emits
$(r,d,h)$ only when it already satisfies:

- room capacity $\mathrm{cap}_r \ge n_s$ (the virtual `Online` room is exempt — unlimited);
- block-aware room category, capacity, lab pinning and ownership as described in §0;
- undergrad window: $h \ge \texttt{cfg.horizon\_start}$ and $h + \ell_b \le \texttt{cfg.undergrad\_end}$ (default 9–18; tunable);
- graduate window (level > 4): $h \ge \texttt{cfg.grad\_start\_for(dept)}$ and $h + \ell_b \le \texttt{cfg.grad\_end}$ (default start 18, end fixed 21);
- configured blackout slots (`Config.blackout`; none by default — each is universal or
  full-time-only, resolved per section via `cfg.closed_hours`);
- per-instructor availability (`Config.instr_unavailable`) — a candidate is dropped if any of
  the section's instructors is marked unavailable over its span;
- fixed-slot pin — a section's first block is restricted to its declared `(day, start)`;
- assistant unavailable slots for required P/L assistants; all listed assistants must be free.
- room-type matching follows §0, including unlimited online supply.

Best-fit additionally caps each block to the `max_rooms_per_block` smallest fitting rooms.
The CP-SAT monolith uses the default cap (12). The repair path widens it to **every physical
room** (`repair._repair_room_cap`): a fixed small cap starves tiny sections — e.g. dozens of
2–5-student 4th-year seminars all contend for the same handful of smallest rooms, which
saturate while larger rooms sit unoffered — so the cap is sized to the room inventory rather
than a constant. Best-fit *ordering* still tries the smallest fitting room first, so room
utilisation is unaffected; only the reachable set grows.

---

## 4. Hard constraints

Listed one per block. Each is a model relation; the per-block rules folded into pruning
(capacity, lab-room, window, blackout) are **not** repeated here.

### H1 — placement (exactly one)

$$
\sum_{(r,d,h)\,\in\,\mathcal{C}(b)} x_{b,r,d,h} \;=\; 1 \qquad \forall\, b \in B
$$

- Every block is scheduled exactly once, into one of its legal candidates.
- Because the sum is over $\mathcal{C}(b)$ only, an infeasible placement is unreachable.
- In `repair` this is **soft** (a block may stay unplaced) so a partial schedule always
  exists; in `model_cpsat` it is hard.

### H2 — room no-overlap

$$
\sum_{\substack{b,\,h' \,:\, h\,\in\,[h',\,h'+\ell_b)}} x_{b,r,d,h'} \;\le\; 1
\qquad \forall\, r \in R_{\text{phys}},\; d,\; h
$$

- At most one block occupies a physical room during any hour-slot.
- The inner condition $h\in[h',h'+\ell_b)$ expands a block over every hour it spans.
- The virtual `Online` room is excluded from $R_{\text{phys}}$ — it has unlimited capacity
  and is exempt from this constraint.

### H3 — instructor no-overlap

$$
\sum_{\substack{b \,:\, i \in I_b}}\ \sum_{\substack{h' \,:\, h\,\in\,[h',\,h'+\ell_b)}} x_{b,\cdot,d,h'} \;\le\; 1
\qquad \forall\, i \in I,\; d,\; h
$$

- No instructor is double-booked in any hour-slot.
- A team-taught section enters the sum of **every** co-instructor.

### H_self — intra-section no-overlap

$$
\sum_{\substack{b \in B_s,\, h' \,:\, h\,\in\,[h',\,h'+\ell_b)}} x_{b,\cdot,d,h'} \;\le\; 1
\qquad \forall\, s \in S,\; d,\; h
$$

- Distinct blocks of the same section never overlap (a student in the section could not
  attend both).
- Same shape as H3 but grouped by section instead of instructor.

### S_day — theory different-day soft preference

$$
\operatorname{extra}_{s,d}
\;\ge\;
\sum_{b \,\in\, B_s} z_{s,b,d} - 1
\qquad \forall\, s \in S,\; d \in D,
\qquad z_{s,b,d} = \max_{r,h} x_{b,r,d,h}
$$

- A section's split sessions prefer different days (e.g. a $2+1$ split prefers two days, not
  one), but the solver may use same-day placement when capacity is tight.
- Soft in both paths: `model_cpsat` uses `w_nonadjacent`; `repair` penalises same-day theory
  siblings with `_W_SAME_DAY = 50` in greedy construction (`_soft_score`) and soft polish
  (`_norm_obj`). The mini CP-SAT `repair_round` instead weights its same-day terms at
  `max(1, big // 4)` (proportional to the placement cost, typically ≈2500). NOT a
  `Violation`; do not add to `validate.py`.
- Lab blocks may also contribute to the generic CP-SAT split-day soft term; the repair
  `_W_SAME_DAY` term applies to theory siblings.

> **Cohort overlap and theory different-day are deliberately not hard constraints.**
> A hard cohort rule was proven infeasible at scale (soft term §5.15). Different-day was
> softened to allow last-resort same-day packing when capacity is tight. "0 resource conflicts"
> therefore means H2, H3, H_self plus the pruned rules (capacity, lab-room, candidate time
> window, blackout) all hold for placed blocks; `validate.py` re-checks the window end-cap but
> not the start lower bound. Theory day-spread is a soft preference in both solver paths.
> Unplaced tails are tracked separately as placement violations.

---

## 5. Soft objective

The CP-SAT monolith (§6a) and the repair soft polish (§6b) minimize different weighted-sum
objectives. Weights live in `config.py`. The repair polish objective (`soft_search._norm_obj`)
normalizes these non-guard terms: `w_idle`, `w_maxrun`, `w_instr_days`, `w_nonadjacent`
(instructor day-span meaning), `w_evening`, `w_instr_idle`, `w_fairness`, `w_room_stable`,
`w_free_day`, `w_room_util`, `w_min_working_days`, `w_parallel_coord`, `w_instr_avoid`,
`w_instr_prefer`, `w_avoid_pairs`, `w_building_change`, `w_dept_compact`, `w_dept_fairness`,
`w_perturbation`, `w_session_gap`, and `_W_SAME_DAY`/`same_day_theory`. The monolith has
terms not in the polish objective (`w_cohort_gap`, `w_order`, `w_englab`) and also uses
`w_nonadjacent` with a different split-block same-day meaning (§5.16). `w_cohort_conflict`
appears in both but as an objective term in the monolith and as a no-regress guard in the
polish.

$$
\min \;\; \sum_{t} w_t \cdot \mathrm{pen}_t
$$

### 5.1 Instructor-days — $w_{\text{instr}}=10.0$ (full-time), $w_{\text{pt}}=14.0$ (part-time)

$$
\mathrm{pen}_{\text{days}} \;=\; \sum_{i,d} w_i\, \delta_{i,d},
\qquad \delta_{i,d} = \big[\, i \text{ teaches on day } d \,\big]
$$

- One unit per distinct day an instructor teaches → compress each instructor's week.
- Part-time staff carry the heavier weight (fewer trips to campus).

**Semantics differ by path.** In the CP-SAT monolith the weight applies to *every* teaching
day; in the repair soft polish it applies to days **beyond the target** $T = $ `max_instr_days`
($\max(0,\ \text{days}_i - T)$). In the School-Settings/UI path, `build_config` forces
`w_instr_days = w_parttime_days = 0` when `instr_days_target` is "No target",
making the term inert. UI default is **No target** (opt-in; the term is inert). Raw `Config()` still carries the
legacy nonzero weights used by CLI/model tests unless a Settings dict is built.

**Target lever (`instr_days_target` → `max_instr_days`).** The School-Settings control maps
**No target → $T = $ week length** (5, or 6 with Saturday) which is the term's **off state**
(no headroom ⇒ inert ⇒ the build forces $w_{\text{instr}} = w_{\text{pt}} = 0$), and **≤4 /
≤3 / ≤2 → $T = 4/3/2$**, which creates headroom so the priority dial steers. Default is **No
target** (opt-in; an untouched settings step leaves the term inert). The consolidation
move in the soft polish (`soft_search`) is gated on $T < $ week length, so a weight alone
cannot steer this term — *the target must create headroom first*.

### 5.2 Cohort idle gaps — $w_{\text{gap}}=10.0$ (monolith) / $w_{\text{idle}}=15.0$ (repair polish)

$$
\mathrm{gap}_{k,d} \;\ge\; \mathrm{last}_{k,d} - \mathrm{first}_{k,d} - \mathrm{load}_{k,d},
\qquad \mathrm{pen}_{\text{gap}} = \sum_{k,d} \mathrm{gap}_{k,d}
$$

- Penalizes idle gaps inside a cohort's day: span (last $-$ first) minus busy hours.
- In the CP-SAT monolith, `w_cohort_gap` applies to cohorts of year level
  $\in\{2,3,4\}$ (`compact_cohort_years`). In the repair soft polish, `idle`
  is computed over all cohorts.
- $\mathrm{first}/\mathrm{last}$ are min/max active hour of the cohort that day.
- In the CP-SAT monolith the weight is `w_cohort_gap=10.0`; in the repair soft polish the
  same metric is `idle`, weighted `w_idle=15.0` (always-on, fixed — not a UI dial).

### 5.3 Maxrun — $w_{\text{maxrun}}=10.0$ (repair polish)

- Penalizes cumulative consecutive teaching hours beyond `max_consecutive_hours`=3, over both
  cohorts and instructors.
- Repair soft polish term only. UI dial: off / low / medium / high (default medium).

### 5.4 Compact teaching days — $w_{\text{nonadjacent}}$ (repair polish)

- Measures the span between each instructor's first and last teaching day of the week
  (`max_day_idx − min_day_idx`; e.g. Mon+Fri = 4, Mon+Tue = 1, single day = 0). Sum across all
  instructors is the `nonadjacent` term.
- UI default 10.0/medium (`Config()` default 0.0); `settings.build_config` maps low/medium/high → 5.0/10.0/20.0.
- Repair soft polish term only. UI dial: off / low / medium / high (default medium).

### 5.5 Late-hour load — $w_{\text{evening}}$ (repair polish)

- Counts occupied hour-slots at or after `evening_from_hour` (default 17:00), once for the
  affected cohort load and once for the affected instructor load. A 17:00-18:00 block taught
  by one instructor therefore contributes 2 raw units: one cohort unit and one instructor unit.
- Raw `Config()` default is 0.0 (off). The UI's `DEFAULT_SETTINGS` starts at medium, so
  `settings.build_config` maps the untouched UI to 10.0; low / medium / high map to
  5.0 / 10.0 / 20.0 and explicit off maps to 0.0.
- Repair soft polish term only. UI dial: off / low / medium / high (default medium).

### 5.6 Instructor idle gaps — $w_{\text{instr\_idle}}$ (repair polish)

$$
\mathrm{idle}_{i,d} = \max(H_{i,d}) + 1 - \min(H_{i,d}) - |H_{i,d}|
$$

- Penalizes holes inside an instructor's same-day teaching span, mirroring the cohort idle
  gap definition but scoped to instructors only.
- Raw `Config()` default is 0.0 (off). The UI's `DEFAULT_SETTINGS` starts at medium, so
  `settings.build_config` maps the untouched UI to 10.0; low / medium / high map to
  5.0 / 10.0 / 20.0 and explicit off maps to 0.0.
- Repair soft polish term only. UI dial: off / low / medium / high (default medium).

### 5.7 Bad-load fairness — $w_{\text{fairness}}$ (repair polish)

$$
\mathrm{pain}_e = \sum_d
  \big(\mathrm{idle\_gap}_{e,d} + \mathrm{run\_excess}_{e,d} + \mathrm{late\_slots}_{e,d}\big),
\qquad
\mathrm{fairness} = \sum_e \mathrm{pain}_e^2
$$

- Entity $e$ ranges over cohorts and instructors. Squaring the per-entity pain penalizes
  concentration: two entities with pain 2+2 cost 8, while one entity with pain 4 costs 16.
- Uses the same ingredients as the student idle, maxrun, and late-hour terms, but changes the
  distribution preference rather than adding a new hard rule.
- Raw `Config()` default is 0.0 (off). The UI's `DEFAULT_SETTINGS` starts at medium, so
  `settings.build_config` maps the untouched UI to 10.0; low / medium / high map to
  5.0 / 10.0 / 20.0 and explicit off maps to 0.0.
- Repair soft polish term only. UI dial: off / low / medium / high (default medium).

### 5.8 Room stability — $w_{\text{room\_stable}}=10.0$ (repair polish)

- Penalizes each section that uses more than one distinct physical room across its blocks
  ($\max(0,\lvert\text{rooms}(s)\rvert - 1)$).
- Repair soft polish term only. UI dial: off / low / medium / high (default medium).

### 5.9 Free day — $w_{\text{free\_day}}=10.0$ (repair polish, year-scoped)

- Penalizes each configured year-level cohort ($\in$ `free_day_year_levels`) that occupies
  all working days (i.e. has no completely empty day in the week).
- Controlled by year scope (multiselect in the UI), not by a weight dial. `w_free_day` resolves
  to 10.0 via `_preset` medium fallback (no UI weight dial; activation is year-scope-only), so
  with no selected years there are no cohorts in scope and the term is inert.

### 5.9a Section minimum working days — $w_{\text{min\_working\_days}}=10.0$ (both paths)

- Reads the optional `Min Working Days` course-list column into `Section.min_working_days`.
- Penalizes `max(0, target_days - actual_distinct_days)` per section, where actual days are
  the distinct days occupied by that section's placed blocks.
- Empty, invalid, or zero values are inert. The target is soft only: unmet targets are
  exported through `schedule["unmet_soft"]`, not reported as hard validation failures.

### 5.9b Parallel section coordination — $w_{\text{parallel\_coord}}=10.0$ (repair polish)

- Reads optional `Parallel Policy` course-list values and Settings overrides into
  `Config.parallel_policies`. Settings rows for a course code override CSV rows.
- Policies are scoped by `Section.code`, not `section_id`, so different sections of the same
  course can be coordinated without changing assignment/export fields.
- `same-time` counts distinct theory `(day,start)` slots beyond the first for each theory block
  tag; `spread` counts extra parallel theory sections sharing a `(day,start)`; `lab-after-theory`
  counts section labs placed before that section's latest theory block.
- This is a soft repair-polish term only in the first version. It never relaxes hard resource
  constraints and cannot pass the `conf` no-regress guard.

### 5.9c Building transition cost — $w_{\text{building\_change}}=0.0$ (both paths)

$$
\mathrm{pen}_{\text{bldg}} \;=\; \sum_{i,d,h}\mathbb{1}\!\left[\mathrm{bldg}(i,d,h) \neq \mathrm{bldg}(i,d,h{+}1)\right]
$$

- For each instructor $i$, day $d$, and consecutive hour pair $(h, h{+}1)$, counts one penalty
  if the instructor occupies both hours in **different** buildings.
- `building_of(room)`: first letter of the room code (`A`–`K`); `XB…` prefix resolves to
  building `X` (bodrum/basement = same building). Online and unknown rooms return `None` and
  are excluded from the count.
- **Repair polish:** tracked as `building_change` in `_global_terms` / `_local_terms` /
  `_norm_obj`. Computation skipped entirely when `w_building_change = 0.0`.
- **CP-SAT monolith:** for every cross-building candidate pair $(v_1, v_2)$ covering adjacent
  hours, introduces a Boolean $t$ with `model.Add(t ≥ v1 + v2 − 1)` and adds $w \cdot t$ to
  the objective. Integer weight: `int(round(w_building_change)) or 1`.
- Default weight is 0.0 (off); no UI dial yet — activate via `Config(w_building_change=…)`.

### 5.9d Department building compactness — $w_{\text{dept\_compact}}$ (repair polish)

$$
\mathrm{pen}_{\text{dept\_compact}} =
\sum_{\text{dept}} \left(\sum_{g}\mathrm{blocks}_{\text{dept},g}
- \max_g \mathrm{blocks}_{\text{dept},g}\right)
$$

- For each department, count placed blocks by known building and penalize the blocks outside
  that department's most-used building. A department entirely in one known building costs 0.
- Building is derived by `building_of(room)`: first letter of the room code (`A`–`K`), with
  `XB…` resolving to `X`. `Online` and unknown rooms return `None` and are ignored.
- **Repair polish only:** tracked as `dept_compactness` in `_global_terms` / `_local_terms` /
  `_norm_obj`. It is not modeled in the CP-SAT monolith.
- Raw `Config()` default is 0.0 (off). The UI's `DEFAULT_SETTINGS` starts at medium, so
  `settings.build_config` maps the untouched UI to 10.0; low / medium / high map to
  5.0 / 10.0 / 20.0 and explicit off maps to 0.0.

### 5.9e Department prime-time fairness — $w_{\text{dept\_fairness}}$

For each department $d$, let $p_d$ be scheduled teaching hours inside
`[cfg.primetime_start, cfg.primetime_end)` and $t_d$ be total scheduled teaching hours. The
penalty is the cross-multiplied pairwise ratio spread:

$$
\mathrm{pen}_{\text{dept\_fairness}} =
\sum_{d_1 < d_2} |p_{d_1}t_{d_2} - p_{d_2}t_{d_1}|
$$

- Counts occupied teaching hours, not blocks. A two-hour class contributes two hours.
- Department key is `Section.department`, falling back to `dept_code`; blank departments are
  ignored, and schedules with fewer than two departments cost 0.
- The cross-multiplied form keeps CP-SAT integer-linear while comparing ratios instead of raw
  prime-time counts, so larger departments are not punished for having more total hours.
- Active in the CP-SAT monolith and repair soft polish when the weight is nonzero. Raw
  `Config()` default is 0.0 (off). The UI's `DEFAULT_SETTINGS` starts at medium, so
  `settings.build_config` maps the untouched UI to 10.0; low / medium / high map to
  5.0 / 10.0 / 20.0 and explicit off maps to 0.0.

### 5.10 S-Order — $w_{\text{order}}=1$ (monolith)

$$
\mathrm{pen}_{\text{order}} \;=\; \sum_{b,r,d,h} w_{\text{order}}\,(4-\mathrm{lvl}_s)\,(h-\texttt{cfg.horizon\_start})\; x_{b,r,d,h}
\qquad (\,2 \le \mathrm{lvl}_s \le 4\,)
$$

- Encourages low-level courses early and high-level courses late in the day.
- Coefficient grows with start hour and with how low the level is; level-1 and graduate
  excluded.

### 5.11 S-EngLab — $w_{\text{englab}}=1$ (monolith)

$$
\mathrm{pen}_{\text{englab}} \;=\; \sum_{\substack{b \text{ Eng. lab}\\ (r,d,h):\, d \notin \{\mathrm{Th,Fr}\}}} x_{b,r,d,h}
$$

- One unit per Engineering **lab** block placed off Thursday/Friday (`eng_lab_days`).
- Matches sections whose faculty contains `eng_department_match` $=$ "Engineering".

### 5.12 S-RoomUtil — $w_{\text{room\_util}}=1$ (both paths)

$$
\mathrm{pen}_{\text{room\_util}} \;=\; \sum_{b,r,d,h} w_{\text{room\_util}}\,\frac{\mathrm{cap}_r - n_s}{\mathrm{cap}_r}\; x_{b,r,d,h}
\qquad (\,\mathrm{cap}_r > n_s,\; s \text{ not virtual}\,)
$$

- Penalizes the **waste fraction** `(cap_r − n_s) / cap_r ∈ [0, 1)` per placed block, not the raw seat slack. A 10-student section in a 200-seat auditorium (fraction 0.95) is penalized only slightly more than in a 100-seat room (fraction 0.90), rather than 2× more as the raw formula would give.
- Discourages assigning small classes to very large auditoriums; rooms that exactly fit are preferred.
- Room capacity is soft: candidates include compatible undersized rooms and a strong
  shortfall penalty prefers sufficient capacity whenever it exists. A shortfall never
  relaxes room type, ownership, reservation, or occupancy constraints.
- Virtual rooms (cap = 0) are exempt via the `c.cap > 0` guard.
- CP-SAT monolith uses integer-scaled form `100 × (cap_r − n_s) // cap_r` (percentage, 0–99); repair `_cand_soft` and the move-based polish (`_global_terms` / `_norm_obj`) use the float fraction directly.

### 5.13 S-InstrAvoid — $w_{\text{avoid}}=3.0$ (both paths)

$$
\mathrm{pen}_{\text{avoid}} \;=\; \sum_{b,r,d,h} x_{b,r,d,h} \sum_{i \in I_b} \sum_{h' \in [h, h+\ell_b)} \mathbf{1}[(i,d,h') \in \mathrm{avoid}]
$$

- Penalizes each instructor-hour that falls in an **avoid** slot. A 2-hour block by an
  instructor with hour $h$ in avoid contributes `w_instr_avoid` per overlapping hour.
- Avoid slots do **not** prune candidates — the block can still be placed there at a cost.
- In the CP-SAT monolith, coefficients are integer-rounded: `int(round(w_instr_avoid))`.
- In the repair soft polish, tracked as the `instr_avoid_viol` term in `_global_terms` /
  `_local_terms` / `_norm_obj`.

### 5.14 S-InstrPrefer — $w_{\text{prefer}}=2.0$ (both paths)

$$
\mathrm{pen}_{\text{prefer}} \;=\; \sum_{b} x_{b,\cdot,d,h}
  \sum_{\substack{i \in I_b \\ i \in \mathrm{prefer\_ids}}}
  \mathbf{1}\!\left[\nexists\, h' \in [h,h+\ell_b): (i,d,h') \in \mathrm{preferred}\right]
$$

- For each instructor who has declared **preferred** hours, penalizes placements where the
  block does **not** land in any of the instructor's preferred slots (a miss-penalty, not a
  bonus). Only instructors with at least one preferred slot (`instr_prefer_ids`) contribute,
  so absent-preference instructors are free.
- A miss-penalty keeps all costs non-negative (vs. a bonus that could dominate the objective).
- In the repair soft polish, tracked as the `instr_prefer_miss` term in `_global_terms` /
  `_local_terms` / `_norm_obj`.

### 5.15 Cohort-conflict — $w_{\text{coh}}=50$

$$
\mathrm{excess}_{k,d,h} \;\ge\; \Big(\textstyle\sum_{c} \mathrm{busy}_{k,c,d,h}\Big) - 1,
\qquad \mathrm{pen}_{\text{coh}} = \sum_{k,d,h} \mathrm{excess}_{k,d,h}
$$

- For each cohort-slot, penalizes every **distinct course** busy beyond the first
  ($\mathrm{busy}_{k,c,d,h}=\max x$ over that course's blocks in the slot).
- A *soft* proxy: $(\text{dept},\text{year})$ over-counts conflict because students split
  across electives, so a hard rule was infeasible. High weight (50) but not prohibitive.
- In the CP-SAT monolith this enters the objective directly; in the repair solver it is a
  **no-regress guard** (`conf`): soft-polish moves are rejected if `conf` would exceed the
  polish-start baseline (`base["conf"]`), not the running current value — so if polish
  incidentally reduces `conf`, it may rise again as long as it stays ≤ the baseline.
- Reported as `cohort_conflicts`; **never** a `Violation` in `validate`.

### 5.16 Non-adjacent split — $w_{\text{nonadjacent}}$ (CP-SAT monolith only)

- In the CP-SAT monolith (≤50 sections path) `w_nonadjacent` penalizes a section's split
  blocks sharing the same day — a narrower, block-level meaning distinct from §5.4.
  This is now the CP-SAT theory day-spread mechanism; repair has its own `_W_SAME_DAY`
  soft penalty for the same preference.

### 5.17 S-AvoidPairs — $w_{\text{avoid\_pairs}}=1.0$ (both paths)

$$
\mathrm{slots}(c) \;=\; \bigcup_{b:\,\mathrm{code}(b)=c}\; \{(d,h) : h \in [\mathrm{start}_b, \mathrm{start}_b+\ell_b)\}
$$

$$
\mathrm{pen}_{\text{avoid\_pairs}} \;=\; \sum_{\{c_a,c_b\} \in \mathrm{avoid\_pairs}} \;\bigl|\,\mathrm{slots}(c_a) \cap \mathrm{slots}(c_b)\,\bigr|
$$

- For each user-defined code pair `{code_a, code_b}`, counts the number of `(day, hour)` slots
  simultaneously occupied by at least one block of `code_a` and at least one block of `code_b`.
  Each overlapping hour contributes one unit of penalty.
- Configured via the **Avoid Conflict** panel in School Settings as a list of
  `[code_a, code_b]` rows. Parsed by `settings.build_config` into
  `Config.avoid_pairs: tuple[frozenset, ...]`.
- In the **CP-SAT monolith**, implemented via `code_day_hour_vars` auxiliary bool variables
  (`code_active[code][d][h]` = OR over all blocks of that code at that hour); the intersection
  term is a linearised AND added to the objective.
- In the **repair soft polish**, computed by `_avoid_pairs_viol` in `repair.py` and exposed
  as the `"avoid_pairs_viol"` key in `_global_terms` / `_local_terms` / `_norm_obj`.
- Default weight 1.0 (always-on when pairs are configured). With no configured pairs the term
  is inert (empty tuple → zero penalty).

## 6. Solution methods

Both solvers share the same candidate generation and constraints.

**(a) Monolithic — `model_cpsat.build_and_solve`.**

- Builds the full model above and calls CP-SAT once.
- Used for **scoped** runs (a faculty/department, Mode A/B benchmarking).
- A single *global* solve (~367 k variables) returns **UNKNOWN** — it does not scale to the
  full period, which is why (b) exists.

**(b) Repair — `repair.solve_repair` (`--repair`, production).**

1. **Greedy construction (soft-shaping)** — place each block in its **lowest soft-score**
   feasible candidate (ties broken by candidate order = best-fit room). `_soft_score` always
   includes `_W_SAME_DAY = 50` when a theory block would share a day with a sibling theory
   block; when `soft_shaping_in_repair=True` it also adds
   `w_cohort_conflict·new_cohort_conflicts`; and when an instructor-days target is active it
   adds a tie-break of 1 per new instructor-day beyond target. Cohort-conflict shaping is **on
   by default** (`soft_shaping_in_repair=True`, `--no-soft-shaping` to disable).
   `new_cohort_conflicts` is myopic (sees only already-placed blocks), so the reduction is
   partial but cheap and placement-safe.
2. **Warm-started small-neighbourhood repair** — repeatedly free a small batch of unplaced
   blocks plus their competitors and re-solve that neighbourhood with CP-SAT (soft H1,
   warm-started from the current placement); frozen blocks stay as reservations. Loop until
   no gains.
3. **Move-based soft polish** (`soft_search.anneal_soft`) — once placement converges,
   re-seat already-placed blocks to lower the normalized non-guard objective
   (idle / maxrun / instr_days / nonadjacent / evening / instr_idle / fairness /
   room_stable / free_day / room_util / min_working_days / parallel_coord /
   instr_avoid_viol / instr_prefer_miss / avoid_pairs_viol / building_change /
   dept_compactness / dept_fairness / perturbation / session_gap / same_day_theory)
   under a `conf` no-regress guard.
   Moves: relocate, chain, swap, consolidate_instr, free_cohort_day. Acceptor: Great Deluge
   (default). Bounded by the `repair_time_limit_s` deadline; the placement count never
   decreases (hard placement guard + accept guard).

**Pseudocode — `solve_repair`**

`solve_repair` accepts an optional `progress_cb=None` callable. When provided, it is called once at each of the 4 phase boundaries below with an event tuple:

| Call site | Tuple emitted |
| --- | --- |
| After candidate generation, before sort | `("gen_candidates", total_blocks)` |
| Before greedy construction | `("construct", None)` |
| After `unplaced` recheck, before sort (each sweep where `unplaced ≠ []`) | `("repair_sweep", sweep_number, n_unplaced)` |
| Before `anneal_soft` (only if `soft_polish_in_repair`) | `("soft_polish", None)` |

`pipeline.py` additionally fires `("validate", None)` immediately before calling `validate()`. The UI (`views/solve.py`) maps these 5 event keys to step labels ("1/5 · …" … "5/5 · …") and drives a Python-controlled progress bar (no JS timers).

## 7. Validation (independent)

`validate.py` re-derives the core hard-resource violations directly from the assignment list,
importing no solver internals, so model/encoding bugs in those checked rules cannot pass
silently. It checks: room,
instructor, capacity, **lab_room**, **room_type** (categorical room demand), **fixed** (pinned
first block), window end-cap only ($h + \ell_b \le \texttt{end\_cap}$; `validate.py` does not check the start lower bound), where $\texttt{end\_cap} = \texttt{cfg.undergrad\_end}$ (default 18:00) for level ≤ 4 and $\texttt{cfg.grad\_end}$ (default 21:00) for graduate sections, blackout, **instructor_unavailable** (per-instructor
availability), H_self. Cohort conflict and theory different-day are **soft metrics**,
not `Violation`s — never failing validation.

### 7.1 Independent verification (point-in-time, 2026-06-23)

A full-roster benchmark run (`validate.py` over repair solver output) returned
**0 genuine resource conflicts** on both sample datasets. The remaining validator
violations were `placement` violations for the reported unplaced tail:

`repair` is not solver-free: after greedy construction, each `repair_round` builds a
mini CP-SAT model over a bounded neighbourhood (§6b). Those rounds may leave a block unplaced
under a time budget, but they do not introduce illegal resource placements.

## 8. UI-adjustable parameters (School Settings)

Everything in §§2–6 is a `Config` default tuned to our own institution. The UI's **Step 2 —
School Settings** (`views/settings.py`) lets another school override a curated subset *without
touching code*: the step writes a plain **Settings** dict (plus an availability map) into
session state, and `settings.build_config(settings, availability, solve_seconds)` maps it into
a `Config` at solve time. The mapping is **backward-compatible by construction** —
`DEFAULT_SETTINGS` defines the UI's starting point; an untouched step reproduces the exact
UI-default behavior documented above. Note: several optional dials (`w_nonadjacent`, `w_evening`, `w_instr_idle`,
`w_fairness`, `w_dept_compact`, `w_dept_fairness`, `w_session_gap`) have `Config()` default 0.0
(off) but `DEFAULT_SETTINGS` sets them to medium/10.0 — the two defaults deliberately differ. `build_config` **never raises**:
every bad field falls back to its default and the solve proceeds.

### 8.1 Policy & block structure (the "Policy" expander)

| UI control | Range | `Config` field | Effect |
|---|---|---|---|
| Day start | 6–12 | `horizon_start` | earliest start hour (default 09:00) |
| Day end | 13–21 | `undergrad_end` | undergrad end-of-day window (default 18:00) |
| Instructor-days target | No target / ≤4 / ≤3 / ≤2 | `max_instr_days` + `w_instr_days` | No target → term off (weight forced 0); ≤4/≤3/≤2 sets target and activates the instr_days soft term; **No target is the default** (opt-in). See §5.1. |
| Saturday | checkbox | `saturday_enabled` | add Sa to the teaching week |
| Graduate | (always True — not a UI control; hardcoded `s["include_grad"] = True` in `views/settings.py`) | `include_grad` | graduate courses are always scheduled; the field exists in `Config` and `DEFAULT_SETTINGS` but no checkbox is rendered. |
| Graduate earliest start | 6–20 | `grad_start` | earliest hour a graduate block may start (default 18:00). Lower it to allow daytime graduate classes; guarded to `day_start ≤ grad_start < 21`, else reverts to 18. |
| Lunch break | (not currently rendered in UI) | `lunch_enabled`, `lunch_start`, `lunch_end` | `build_config` supports it: when on, `[lunch_start, lunch_end)` is closed every active day as a universal blackout. Present in `DEFAULT_SETTINGS` but no UI control is shown; effectively always off. |

The day window is guarded (`0 ≤ day_start < day_end ≤ 21`); out-of-order values silently
revert to `9 / 18`. The AM/PM boundary for legacy half-day availability is no longer a
user-facing control — it is fixed at 13:00.

### 8.2 Preference weights (low / medium / high, plus optional off)

Schools pick a **plain-language level**, never a raw number. Presets: `UI_REF=20.0` ×
`WEIGHT_LEVELS` → low=5.0, medium=10.0, high=20.0 (uniform across all dials).

All listed dials use `_optional_preset` and expose an explicit **off** state (0.0). (`w_free_day`
uses `_preset` — no off state — but it is not a weight dial; activation is year-scope-only.)
All default to **medium** (10.0) except **Instructor days**, which defaults to **No target** (off — see footnote ¹):

| UI control | `Config` field(s) | off / low / medium / high |
|---|---|---|
| Maxrun | `w_maxrun` (§5.3) | 0.0 / 5.0 / 10.0 / 20.0 |
| Instructor days¹ | `w_instr_days` / `w_parttime_days` (§5.1) | 0.0 / 5.0 / 10.0 / 20.0 |
| Compact teaching days | `w_nonadjacent` (§5.4) | 0.0 / 5.0 / 10.0 / 20.0 |
| Room stability | `w_room_stable` (§5.8) | 0.0 / 5.0 / 10.0 / 20.0 |
| Late-hour load | `w_evening` (§5.5) | 0.0 / 5.0 / 10.0 / 20.0 |
| Instructor idle gaps | `w_instr_idle` (§5.6) | 0.0 / 5.0 / 10.0 / 20.0 |
| Bad-load fairness | `w_fairness` (§5.7) | 0.0 / 5.0 / 10.0 / 20.0 |
| Department building compactness | `w_dept_compact` (§5.9d) | 0.0 / 5.0 / 10.0 / 20.0 |
| Department prime-time fairness | `w_dept_fairness` (§5.9e) | 0.0 / 5.0 / 10.0 / 20.0 |
| Spread session days | `w_session_gap` (§0 soft-preference summary) | 0.0 / 5.0 / 10.0 / 20.0 |

`free_day` (§5.9) has a fixed `Config` weight of 10.0 and is not exposed as a dial — only its
year scope (multiselect) is configurable. With no selected years it is inert. `w_cohort_gap=10.0`
is not exposed as a dial — `settings.build_config` reads it via the preset fallback
(`_preset(weights, "cohort_gap")`), but since no UI control writes "cohort_gap" into the
weights dict it always resolves to the medium preset (10.0). `w_building_change` (§5.9c)
is still Config-only; no Settings UI control writes it.

¹ Only active when `instr_days_target` is set. With "No target", `build_config()` forces
`w_instr_days = 0.0` and `w_parttime_days = 0.0`; when active,
`w_parttime_days = w_instr_days + 4.0`.

### 8.3 Solve quality (Fast / Balanced / Best)

A segmented button in the Settings step that controls how long `anneal_soft` (§6b) runs after
placement converges. Stored as `"quality_mode"` in the Settings dict;
`settings.quality_seconds(mode)` maps it to `cfg.soft_polish_budget_s` inside `build_config`.

| Mode | `soft_polish_budget_s` | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Fast | 180 s | Quick polish; useful when iterating on settings. |
| Balanced | 300 s **(default)** | Recommended for most schools. |
| Best | 600 s | Longest polish; best room-stability and anti-fatigue results. |

The actual polish time is `min(soft_polish_budget_s, max(30, 0.75 × placed_count), remaining_deadline)` — see §6b pseudocode. Hard constraints are never affected; only the non-guard soft-objective terms in `soft_search._norm_obj` can improve: idle, maxrun, instr_days, nonadjacent, evening, instr_idle, fairness, room_stable, free_day, room_util, min_working_days, parallel_coord, instr_avoid_viol, instr_prefer_miss, avoid_pairs_viol, building_change, dept_compactness, dept_fairness, perturbation, session_gap, and same_day_theory.

### 8.4 Blackouts (add/remove list)

Each row is `[day, hour, staff_only]` → a `Config.blackout` triple. `staff_only = false` → a
**universal** blackout (closed for everyone); `staff_only = true` → a **full-time-only**
blackout (closed only when a section has a full-time staff instructor — e.g. a faculty seminar).
**Empty by default** (no blackout slots). The *lunch break* toggle (§8.1) adds its own universal
slots over `[lunch_start, lunch_end)` for every active day. All are enforced by candidate
pruning (§3).

### 8.5 Instructor availability (the "Availability" expander)

Per-instructor (keyed by the **normalized display name** from the uploaded course list;
email columns are ignored) a **per-hour grid** (one checkbox per teaching
hour over `[day_start, day_end)` on each active day) marks unavailable slots, stored as a
frozenset of `(identity, day, hour)` closed slots (`availability_closed_slots`) →
`Config.instr_unavailable`. A candidate is pruned if **any** co-instructor of the section is
closed over the block's span (hard, §3). Legacy half-day codes (`AM = [day_start, 13)`,
`PM = [13, 21)`) are still decoded on load so older saved data keeps working; the AM/PM boundary
is fixed at 13:00.

### 8.6 School profile (the "Profile" expander) — *currently disabled in the UI*

The profile import/export (`profile_to_json` / `profile_from_json`, `views/settings._profile`)
would download the current Settings + availability as `kairos_school_profile.json` and restore
it from an upload (`profile_from_json` merges only **known** keys onto `DEFAULT_SETTINGS`, so a
partial or older file stays safe). The render call is **commented out** for now — an out-of-spec
JSON upload can crash the parser — so the expander is not shown; the pure functions remain for
when the upload path validates the schema defensively.

### 8.7 Adjacent but *not* in the Settings step

- **Solve budget** (`solve_time_limit_s` / `repair_time_limit_s`) comes from the **Solve** step,
  not Settings; it is the `solve_seconds` argument to `build_config`.
- **Course-list column overrides** ride on the uploaded CSV, not the Settings dict: `Year`,
  `Part-time`, `Room Type`, `Fixed`, and `Min Working Days` override the string-derived
  cohort / part-time / lab / pinned-slot defaults or add a per-row soft day-spread target
  (§0, §3).
- **Fixed at `config.py` defaults — deliberately not exposed:** the cohort-conflict weight
  (`w_cohort_conflict=50`, §5.15), the always-on idle weight (`w_idle=15.0`, §5.2),
  cohort-compactness (`w_cohort_gap=10.0`, §5.2), level-ordering (`w_order`, §5.10),
  Engineering-lab preference (`w_englab`, §5.11), and the repair soft-shaping toggle (§6b).
  These are calibrated globals, not per-school policy.


## Institution-neutral integration

See [SCHEDULING_GUIDE.md](SCHEDULING_GUIDE.md) for identity, single-column room interpretation,
compatibility tradeoffs, examples and manual verification. Assistant profile maps
are stored in Settings under assistant_availability, assistant_availability_avoid
and assistant_availability_prefer; build_config exposes separate assistant_* sets.
Profiles keep their existing four-element return contract. Instructor-only workload
and day metrics remain unchanged. Hard occupancy is block-aware in every solver.
CSV/JSON append assistant_id, assistant_name, room_type and is_online; block_kind
is theory/practice/lab. PDF and results show assistants on P/L only.
